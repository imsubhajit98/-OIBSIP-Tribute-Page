                    Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was the eleventh President of India, serving
                    from 2002 to 2007. He was born on May 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu, and studied physics as well as aeronautical engineering. In
                    2002, APJ Abdul Kalam was chosen as India’s 11th President, Having
                    backing from both the ruling Bharatiya Janata as well as the
                    opposing Indian National Congress After his one tenure as President,
                    APJ Abdul Kalam resumed civilian life in teaching, writing, and
                    public service.

                <h5>
                    Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, but his
                    teachers recognised him as having a tremendous desire to study. He
                    finished his secondary studies at Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz
                    Secondary School. In 1955, he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College
                    at Tiruchirappalli with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went
                    to Madras to further his education, graduating from the Engineering
                    And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft engineering. His
                    dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF only had
                    eight slots available, and he finished ninth. Following graduation,
                    he worked as a scientist for the “Defense Research Service” and the
                    “Aeronautical Development Establishment.”

                    award in 1998. Because of his contribution to arts, science, and technology, he received the SASTRA
